Welcome to Fractalito!

This web app provides a simple, even simplistic, interface to produce beautiful fractals from mathematical equations.
Experiment with all the parameters, run the simulation and see what you get!

Fractals are build by solving a numerical equation where the (x, y) coordinates serve as initial conditions.
If the simulation is divergent, the associated pixel is 0.
If it is convergent, the associated pixel is 1.
By solving the equation across the image plane, we can therefore compute a black & white image.

Define here the parameters of the simulation.
"""
parameters_axis_description = """
Define the x-axis and y-axis range of the image.

Defining wider axis ranges allows to sample more regions in the parameter space, thus potentially finding more "fractal-esque" areas.
However, such areas are known to be found around the center (0,0) point, so the probability of finding such areas away from this point are thin.

Define the pixel resolution of the image.

Increasing the resolution allows to sample more precisely the considered range, thus producing sharper images with more detailed.
However, the number of operations (and thus the computation time) scales quadratically with the resolution.

Define the divergence threshold & dual space sampling.

The solver considers any solution crossing this threshold as divergent.
If checked, the solver will sample the parameter space instead of the initial condition space.

Define the operator of the equation to solve.

The operator defines the equation whose solutions form the pixels of the end image.
It has a strong influence on the convergence & divergence of each solution, and therefore influence a lot on the resulting fractal.
